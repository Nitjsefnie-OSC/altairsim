// BitSerialLine -- an RS-232 line with NO UART behind it: the guest moves the bits itself.
//
// A board that bit-bangs its serial port (the CompuPro Disk 1, port 3 D7) has a latch on the
// transmit wire and a buffer on the receive wire, and nothing else. The guest makes each
// start bit, data bit and stop bit with an OUT, and times them with its own delay loop. The
// far end -- a terminal, a socket, the console -- is a UART, and it is the far end's UART
// that this object models: it turns the levels the guest writes into bytes, and the bytes
// the far end sends into levels the guest reads.
//
// A CHIP, NOT A BOARD, and the levels here are the WIRE'S LOGIC LEVELS: true = MARKING
// (logic 1, the idle line), false = SPACING (logic 0, a start bit). Which way up D7 is on
// the bus is the BOARD'S (the Disk 1 inverts it), and it stays on the board.
//
// THE FRAME is 8 data bits, LSB first, no parity, 1 stop bit, at `baud`. One bit time is
// clock.hz() / baud T-states. hz() is the CPU crystal, and never 0, so under `clock_hz = 0`
// the guest's delay loop and this line still agree: both count T-states.
//
// TRANSMIT. Each level the guest writes is kept with its time. A MARK-to-SPACE edge on an
// idle line starts a frame. The far end samples the middle of each bit: the start bit at
// 0.5 bit times (still SPACE, or it was a glitch and is ignored), data bit i at 1.5 + i,
// and the stop bit at 9.5. A MARK stop bit sends the byte to the stream. A SPACE stop bit
// is a framing error (a break is one): the byte is dropped and drainLog() says so. One
// Clock deadline at 9.5 bit times finishes each frame, so the last byte of a burst goes
// out without waiting for another write.
//
// RECEIVE. A byte waiting on the stream is taken when the guest next reads the line while
// it is idle, and its frame starts at that moment. The level is then a function of the time
// alone: SPACE for the start bit, the data bits, then MARK. No clock event runs per bit.
// Starting the frame when the guest looks, and not when the byte reached the host, is the
// rule Uart1602::poll keeps for the same reason: a ByteStream is buffered and flow-
// controlled, and a byte the guest was not watching for would be data loss the host
// transport does not have.
