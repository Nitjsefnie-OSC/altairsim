# THE EXAMPLES, IN THE LAYOUT A USER ACTUALLY GETS.
#
# examples/ is not a test fixture. It is what we SHIP: a user gets the `altairsim` binary and
# that tree, and nothing else -- no repository, no build directory, no tests. So this file
# does not ask "does the simulator work" -- the simulator's own tests answer that from their
# own fixtures (tests/media, media.cmake), and none of them may read examples/. It asks:
#
#     DOES THE THING WE HAND PEOPLE WORK WHERE WE HAND IT TO THEM?
#
# So it COPIES each example out of the tree, leaving the repository behind, and runs EVERY
# machine file in it from there -- the only arrangement in which a repo-root-relative path in
# an example is visible as the bug it is.
#
# Expects: -DSIM=<altairsim> -DSRC=<source dir> -DBIN=<binary dir> -DHAVE_SDL=<0|1>

# `examples/cpm` is the flagship: it is what docs/manual/quick-start.md promises, and until
# 2026-07-19 NO test booted it. `acceptance-dcdd-readonly` boots a test-owned machine file
# that happens to mount the same image, which proves the CARD and proves nothing at all
# about the example -- and that is much of how the manual drifted as far as it did.
#
# The keys are cpm-dir.keys, and its first byte is a NUL for the same reason basic4k.keys's
# is: every keystroke is in the buffer before the machine is switched on, and CP/M's cold
# start clears the SIO's receive register and eats exactly one byte.

# DIR polls the console between lines so the operator can stop a long listing, and ANY key
# already waiting aborts it. Our keys are all in the pipe before the machine starts, so the
# CR behind `DIR` stops the listing after one line -- every time, and on purpose, since the
# alternative is a test whose output depends on how fast the host is.
#
