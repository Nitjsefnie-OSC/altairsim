# CompuPro Disk 1 floppy disk controller

**Status:** built (`disk1`). The board boots CompuPro CP/M 2.2N from an 8″ disk through routine
4 of `builtin:DISK1`, a dump of a factory EPROM. `tests/test_disk1.cpp` tests the board, and
`acceptance-disk1` boots the tracked disk through the `disk1` machine. The serial line on port 3
is built and tested with a guest program in the unit test. No period program that uses the line
has run on it (see *Limitations*).

## The real hardware

The **CompuPro Disk 1** (board 171F, 1981) is CompuPro's first floppy controller. The Disk 1A
(1984) replaced it. It has four parts:

- an **NEC µPD765A** floppy disk controller (the Intel 8272 is the same part). It runs 8″
  drives, in single and double density. A changed board runs 5.25″ drives instead (§5).
- a **DMA engine** with a 24-bit address counter, the same design as on the Disk 1A. There is
  no byte count and no terminal count.
- a **boot EPROM**, a 2716 of 2 KB. Switches and a jumper pick one 256-byte routine of the
  eight. The routine answers memory reads at `0000`–`00FF` over `PHANTOM*`.
- a **bit-banged serial line** on port 3, D7. There is no UART. The guest makes each bit with
  an `OUT` and times it with a delay loop. The manual says that the line is for the first start
  of a new machine only.

The board decodes four ports at a base that is a multiple of four. The CompuPro base is `C0`.
The console is usually on a separate board, an Interfacer or a System Support 1.

## Register reference

Ports at the base `B` (default `C0`):

| Port | OUT (write) | IN (read) |
|---|---|---|
| `B+0` | nothing (the board does not decode it) | the 765 main status register |
| `B+1` | the 765 data register | the 765 data register |
| `B+2` | the DMA address: three bytes, the high byte first | board status |
| `B+3` | D7: the serial output, or the motor (`port3`). D0 = 0 switches the boot EPROM off | D7: the serial input |

**Board status** (`B+2` IN): bit 7 is the 765's INT. The manual calls bits 0–6 "not
significant". They read 0 here.

**Port 3, D7.** The level is inverted between D7 and the line (§2.2):

| D7 | Line | Bit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | SPACING | 0, and the start bit |
| 0 | MARKING | 1, and the idle line |

A reset clears the output latch to MARKING. With `port3 = motor` (switch S1-3 ON), the latch
drives the MOTOR ON line of the minifloppy cable. D7 = 0 turns the motors on, and D7 = 1 turns
them off (1982 manual). With `port3 = serial`, the minifloppy motors are on all the time.

## How it is simulated

- **The shared base.** The Disk 1 and the Disk 1A are one class, `CompuProDiskBoard`
  (`src/boards/compupro-disk.h`). The class holds the `Upd765`, the DMA engine, the boot EPROM,
  the four drives and the size probe. `CompuProDisk1Board` adds port 3, the status bit and the
  straps. `docs/boards/compupro-disk1a.md` describes the shared parts.
- **The drives** are four `DiskImageDrive`s over raw `.DSK` images, units `drive0`–`drive3`.
- **DMA.** The board takes the bus for each byte, as the Disk 1A does.
- **The boot EPROM** answers memory reads at `0000`–`00FF` and asserts `PHANTOM*`. Memory
  writes go to the RAM below it, so the RAM of the machine must be set
  `honors_phantom = "read"`.
- **The serial line** is a `BitSerialLine` (`src/chips/bitserial.h`), on the unit `serial`.
  The far end is a UART at `baud`, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. It samples the middle of
  each bit that the guest writes, and sends each good byte to the endpoint. A byte from the
  endpoint starts its frame when the guest next reads an idle line. The bit time is counted in
  T-states of the processor clock, so the guest's delay loop and the line agree at
  `clock_hz = 0` too.
- **8″ drives only.** The 765 runs at 8 MHz. The size probe takes 8″ images only and refuses
  an image the size of a 5.25″ disk. The board has no software rate select.
- **The TS line** is the disk's own. With `media`, it is the diskette's sides, formatted or
  blank. Without `media`, it is high when side 1 of the disk has a formatted track. A blank disk
  then reads one-sided until a format writes side 1. The Disk 1 has no Force Two Sided bit.
- **`media` and `create`** on `[[board.drive]]` work as on the Disk 1A
  (`docs/boards/compupro-disk1a.md`, *The `media` of a drive*), with the 8″ values only. CompuPro
  `FORMAT.COM` 3.1c on the 2.2N disk formats a blank drive B only with `media = "8ds"`. The BIOS
  reads no ID from a blank disk, so it keeps the drive's two-sided type and formats head 1. With
  TS low, the 765 reports Not Ready, and FORMAT stops with `Drive Format Error`.
- **The interrupt.** The 765's INT goes to the line that `interrupt` names (jumpers J0–J8). The
  default is `none`. The manual does not give a shipped jumper, and the EPROM and the 2.2N
  BIOS poll status bit 7.

### Properties

| Property | Default | What it sets |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `C0` | The base (switches S2-3 to S2-8). A multiple of 4 |
| `rom` | `builtin:DISK1` | The boot EPROM, or a 2716 image file |
| `routine` | `4` | The 256-byte routine at `0000` (switches S2-1 and S2-2, jumper J17), 0–7. In `builtin:DISK1`, 4–7 are the 8080 routines |
| `boot` | `on` | The boot EPROM (switch S1-4 OFF). Off: a plain disk controller |
| `port3` | `serial` | Switch S1-3. `serial`: D7 is the serial line. `motor`: D7 is the MOTOR ON line, D7 = 0 on |
| `interrupt` | `none` | Jumpers J0–J7 (`vi0`–`vi7`) and J8 (`int`) |

The `serial` unit has `baud` (default 9600) and `connect`.

The `[[board.drive]]` table takes `unit`, `mount`, `readonly` (also `writeprotect`), `media`
and `create`. `media` takes `8ss`, `8ds` and the whole 8″ formats, such as `8ds-dd1024`.

### The routines of `builtin:DISK1`

Routines 4–7 are one 8080 routine. Each passes a different console code in register C, and the
loaded system picks its console from it. CP/M 2.2N, as on the tracked disk, does this:

| Routine | C | Console of CP/M 2.2N |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 0 | Interfacer at `00`/`01` (the `disk1` machine's console) |
| 5 | 1 | An Interfacer at `10`/`11`. The machine has none, so nothing prints |
| 6 | 2 | System Support 1 serial channel. Connect `ss1:serial` to see it |
| 7 | 3 | Interfacer 3 or 4 at `10`. The machine has none, so nothing prints |

Routines 0–3 are 8086 code, and altairsim has no 8086.

### Connect the serial line

The line is a serial unit, as on any serial board:

```
altairsim> CONNECT fd0:serial telnet:2323
altairsim> SET fd0:serial baud=1200
```

Set `baud` to the rate that the guest's delay loop makes. The manual gives the highest rates
for the processor clock: 600 at 2 MHz, 1200 at 4 MHz and 2400 at 6 MHz.

### Reset

- `Reset::PowerOn` and `Reset::Bus` both switch the boot EPROM on again, reset the 765, and
  clear the port 3 latch to MARKING. The disks stay mounted, and the endpoint stays connected.

## Quirks reproduced

| Quirk | If you get it wrong |
|---|---|
| D7 = 1 is SPACING, and a reset leaves the line at MARKING | A guest that bit-bangs the line sends inverted bytes, and the far end sees a break after each reset |
| The EPROM shadows reads only. Writes under it reach the RAM | Code that the guest writes under the EPROM is lost |
| No terminal count. A DMA read runs to the EOT byte of the command, and the 765 ends it with ST0 = `40` and ST1 = EN | The EPROM takes ST0 = `40` with ST1 = `80` as a good read, and starts again on other result bytes |
| The DMA address is a three-deep stack, written high byte first | The boot loads at the wrong address |
| Port 0 OUT is not decoded | A Disk 1A program that writes the Drive Select Register sees no change |
| Status bits 0–6 read 0 | A Disk 1A program that waits for READY in bit 0 runs here and fails on the real board |

## Limitations and deliberate departures

- **The serial line is held at SPACING while CP/M 2.2N runs.** The 2.2N BIOS writes `80h` to
  port `C3`, which sets D7 = 1, and does not write it again. D7 = 1 is SPACING, so the far end
  sees a break. With `port3 = serial`, the board logs one line on each boot: `fd0: serial: a
  break on the line (no stop bit); nothing sent`. The real board holds its line at SPACING in
  the same way.
- **No period program has used the serial line here.** The unit test runs a small 8080 program
  that sends `HELLO` at 1200 baud and echoes three bytes. Routine 5 passes C = 1, but the 2.2N
  BIOS has no driver for the line.
- **No 5.25″ drives.** A Disk 1 runs 5.25″ drives only after a hardware change: other parts,
  three cut traces and new jumpers (1982 manual). The change is not modeled.
- **The motor (`port3 = motor`) has no effect that a guest can read.** The Disk 1 has no ready
  or index bit. The latch is stored and shown, and nothing else.
- **No wait states and no DMA priority** (switches S1-1 and S1-5 to S1-8). The machine has one
  bus master and no slow memory.
- **A16–A23.** The counter counts all 24 bits, but this is a 64 K bus (DESIGN.md §4.0).
- **No M-Drive/H.** The CP/M 2.2N BIOS looks for an M-Drive/H RAM disk, finds 0 boards, and
  continues. The cold-boot program `MFORM` prints `DRIVE SPECIFIED IS NOT A MEMORY DRIVE`.

## Verification

- `tests/test_disk1.cpp` (suite `disk1`) uses real bus cycles. It tests these things:
  - the port map at a moved base, port 0 OUT not decoded, and status bit 7 only
  - the 256-byte EPROM window, `routine` paging, and D0 = 0 and a reset
  - a DMA read of track 0 to `0100`, the 765 at 8 MHz, and the refusal of a 5.25″ image
  - `media`: TS on a blank with `8ds`, `8SS` and no media, the refusal of 5.25″ media and of a
    formatted image of another shape, `CONFIG SAVE` of the media, and `create`
  - `port3 = motor`, the snapshot round trip and the property checks
  - an 8080 guest that bit-bangs `HELLO` at 1200 baud and echoes bytes from a stream
  - `builtin:DISK1`: the default routine 4, routines 5–7 differ only in the console code, and
    each of routines 4–7 boots an 8″ disk with C = 0–3, the EPROM off and the line at MARKING
- `tests/test_bitserial.cpp` (suite `bitserial`) tests the line: one byte, a burst, a break and
  a framing error, at two clock rates and at `clock_hz = 0`.
- `acceptance-disk1` boots `tests/media/compupro/CPM22N.DSK` through routine 4 to the
  `CompuPro Systems 64K CP/M 2.2N` sign-on. It runs `DIR` and `STAT DSK:`. It copies
  `STAT.COM` with `PIP`, runs the copy, and erases it. It then boots the disk through routine 6
  (`tests/media/compupro/cpm22n-ss1.toml`), with the System Support 1 serial channel as the
  console, and runs `DIR`. Last, `tests/media/compupro/cpm22n-format.toml` mounts a blank `8ds`
  disk in drive 1, and `FORMAT.COM` 3.1c formats it as 8 × 1024 with two sides. The image grows
  to 1,256,704 bytes, and `STAT B:DSK:` reports a 1200K drive.
