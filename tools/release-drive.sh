# The coordinator's side of a release build: start tools/release-worker.sh on one build
# machine, PROVE THAT IT STARTED, and read its result. It reads this site's machines from
# distribution.conf (distribution.conf.example names every key).
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT. How a worker is started over ssh was written by hand for each release,
# and it is where the mistakes were (issue #643, and the trap list that the
# `release-coordinator` skill used to carry):
#
#   - `ssh host 'bash -s' < script` gives the script to its own commands as stdin, and the
#     shell's parser loses its place. The script is COPIED to the box and run as a file.
#   - It is copied OUTSIDE the checkout: step 1 of the worker is `git checkout -f`, which can
#     replace a script inside the checkout while it runs.
#   - A foreground ssh that drops takes the build with it. On macOS and Linux the worker runs
#     under `nohup` on the box and writes its log there.
#   - Windows sshd ends a remote background process when the session ends. There the ssh
#     itself runs under a local `nohup`, with a keep-alive, and the log is local. In 1.3.0 a
#     `Start-Process` wrapper printed `started` and ran nothing.
#   - Bash is not on the ssh PATH of a Windows box. It is called by its short path, which has
#     no space in it: C:\PROGRA~1\Git\bin\bash.exe.
#
# AN EMPTY LOG PROVES NOTHING. `start` returns OK only when the checkout on the box is at the
# new tag AND the worker script is a running process there AND its log names this version.
#
#   usage: tools/release-drive.sh preflight [--conf FILE]
#          tools/release-drive.sh start  <target> X.Y.Z [--skip-slow] [--no-deliver]
#                                        [--unsigned] [--repo DIR] [--conf FILE]
#          tools/release-drive.sh status <target> [--conf FILE]
#          tools/release-drive.sh wait   <target>... [--conf FILE]
#
#     <target>      macos-arm64 | macos-x86_64 | linux-x86_64 | windows-x86_64
#     --skip-slow   Do not run the CPU exercisers. For a dry run only.
#     --no-deliver  Do not copy the archive to the coordinator. For a dry run only.
#     --unsigned    macOS: sign ad hoc, do not notarize. For a dry run only. Without it, a
#                   macOS worker signs with <TARGET>_SIGN_IDENTITY and the three keys after
#                   it, and stops before step 1 when they are not set.
#     --repo        Build in this checkout, not in the one that distribution.conf names. Use
#                   it for a dry run of the coordinator's own target in a second clone.
#     --conf        Read this file. Default: distribution.conf in the repository root.
#
# `preflight` runs before the tag, and proves what a release needs (issues #811 and #816):
#   1. The coordinator. Its checkout has no change to a tracked file. A clone of its HEAD
#      configures, builds, packages with the committed manual, and passes verify-package.sh.
#      The clone is in a temporary folder, so the build/ of this checkout is not touched.
#   2. Each worker, only when the coordinator passed. ssh answers, the checkout is reset
#      (`git reset --hard` and `git clean -fdx`), and an scp from the worker to
#      COORDINATOR_DIST arrives. The scp is the one that step 8 of the worker makes.
#   3. On each Mac, the coordinator too: the signing keychain unlocks with its password file,
#      holds <TARGET>_SIGN_IDENTITY, and Apple answers with the notary profile.
# Each check prints `preflight: OK -- <what>` or `preflight: FAIL -- <what>`. The last line is
# `preflight: OK` or `preflight: FAIL`, and the exit status is 0 only for OK.
#
# A WORKER CHECKOUT IS DISPOSABLE. `start` and `preflight` reset it, and print each path that
# `git clean` removed. The coordinator's checkout is never reset: it is a development tree.
#
# `status` prints the end of the worker's log. Its exit status is 0 when the worker printed
# `release-worker: OK`, 1 when it printed FAIL or is gone with no result, and 2 while it
# still runs.
#
# `wait` checks each target once a minute until every worker has ended, so the coordinator
# does not poll by hand (issue #812). Then it prints the report block of each target under
# `##### <target>`, and ONE last line: `release-drive: wait OK -- all N workers OK`, or
# `release-drive: wait FAIL -- <targets>`. Its exit status is 0 only when every worker printed
# `release-worker: OK`. A worker that is gone with no result line is a FAIL.
#
# The coordinator's own target (COORDINATOR_TARGET) runs here, with no ssh and no delivery:
# its archive is written to dist/ directly. Its checkout must have no change to a tracked
# file, because the worker checks out the tag in it.
