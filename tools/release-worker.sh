#
# Build, test, package and deliver ONE release archive on THIS machine, for a tag that the
# coordinator made. These are the eight steps of the `release-worker` skill
# (DISTRIBUTION.md 4.2), each with its CHECK and its STOP, as one script that takes arguments.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FILE IN THE TREE. Before, the coordinator wrote a new worker script from the
# skill for each release, and a script that is written again each time gets new bugs each
# time. 1.3.0 had two (issue #643): a check that read only the last 6 lines of the ctest
# output, where the label summary had pushed the pass line out, and a Windows start that
# printed `started` and ran nothing. The second one is tools/release-drive.sh's job. The
# first one is why EVERY CHECK HERE READS THE FULL OUTPUT of its command, from a file.
#
# ONE SCRIPT FOR ALL FOUR TARGETS. On Windows it runs in Git Bash, which the package steps
# need already (build-package.sh is /bin/sh). cmake and ctest run from Git Bash with the
# Visual Studio generator, which needs no Developer shell.
#
# IT NEVER TAGS, NEVER PUBLISHES, NEVER RUNS gh, AND NEVER PICKS A VERSION. The version is an
# argument. If you do not have it, ask the coordinator; do not read it from `git tag`.
#
# RUN A COPY THAT IS OUTSIDE THE CHECKOUT. Step 1 is `git checkout -f vX.Y.Z`, and that can
# replace this file while the shell still reads it. The script refuses to start from inside
# --repo. tools/release-drive.sh copies it out first.
#
#   usage: release-worker.sh --version X.Y.Z [--repo DIR] [--no-parallel] [--path DIRS]
#                            [--serial-a PORT --serial-b PORT] [--deliver USER@HOST:DIR]
#                            [--skip-slow]
#          release-worker.sh --self-test
#
#     --version      The release, X.Y.Z. The tag is vX.Y.Z. Required.
#     --repo         The checkout to build in. Default: the current directory.
#     --no-parallel  Build without --parallel (a machine short of RAM: the compiler gets
#                    OOM-killed).
#     --path         Directories to put in front of PATH. A non-login ssh shell does not read
#                    the profile that finds cmake.
#     --serial-a/-b  The null-modem pair for serial-hw. Give both or neither. With neither,
#                    the two variables are NOT set: an empty value makes the test fail, where
#                    an unset one makes it skip.
#     --deliver      Where step 8 copies the archive, as scp takes it. Without it, steps 1 to 7
#                    run and the report says `delivered no`.
#     --skip-slow    Do not run the CPU exercisers (step 4c). For a dry run only: a release
#                    runs them.
#     --self-test    Run the checks on sample output and print PASS or FAIL. Builds nothing.
#
# THE OUTPUT ends with the report block of the skill, and then ONE last line:
#   release-worker: OK
#   release-worker: FAIL at step N
# The exit status is 0 for OK and 1 for FAIL.
