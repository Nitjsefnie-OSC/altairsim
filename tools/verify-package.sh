# PROVE THE MANUAL IS TRUE AGAINST THE ACTUAL SHIPPED PACKAGE.
#
# tools/build-package.sh assembles the archive we hand people and STOPS -- it never runs the
# manual's own commands against it, so a chapter can tell a reader to type something that does
# not work in the zip and nothing catches it. That is not hypothetical: the manual promised
# "CP/M in one command" while a published archive carried no media at all (docs/package.map
# and issue #308 record it). This script is the missing half. It takes the finished archive,
# extracts it somewhere `git rev-parse` FAILS -- no repository in sight, exactly the layout a
# user has -- and types the manual's own fenced `$ altairsim ...` commands at the binary that
# is actually in the package, asserting each reaches the prompt the manual says it will.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT, and not a step inside build-package.sh or a ctest case:
#   * build-package.sh's job is to ASSEMBLE AND STOP (like build-checksums.sh). Verifying a
#     finished artifact is a different job, and must be re-runnable against an already-built
#     archive without a rebuild -- which folding it into the packager would forbid.
#   * ctest runs BEFORE packaging (DISTRIBUTION.md 4.2 step 4) and proves the BINARY, not the
#     archive. The archive only exists at release time, and only then do the PDFs (docs.yml)
#     and the windowed-SDL binary that build-package.sh's own gates require exist. So this is
#     a release-time check, wired into DISTRIBUTION.md 4.2 after build-package.sh. CI also runs
#     it (.github/workflows/package.yml, issue #813), on a macos-arm64 package it builds for the
#     purpose, when the manual, the examples or the packaging change.
#
# WHERE THE COMMANDS AND THE PROMPTS COME FROM. The commands are read from the manual SOURCE
# (docs/manual/*.md in this checkout -- the package ships only the rendered PDF), token-expanded
# from docs/package.map with the SAME substitution build-package.sh uses, so the two can never
# disagree about what {{MACHINE_CPM}} means. Extraction is open-ended (any fenced one-liner is a
# candidate); DISPATCH is a small closed table, and a documented example this table does not
# know is a LOUD FAILURE ("add it here"), never a silent skip. That asymmetry is the point: a
# new `$ altairsim {{MACHINE_NEWTHING}}` in a chapter cannot slip past unverified.
#
# A COMMAND WITH OPTIONS after the machine file (`$ altairsim {{MACHINE_CPM}} --mcp`) is not a
# boot-to-prompt walkthrough -- it starts an MCP server, or runs `-x` commands on a disk the reader
# made earlier -- so no driver runs it. It still gets the check that catches the #308 fault: the
# machine file it names must be in the package, and it must be one the dispatch table knows. It
# is tallied apart from the boot checks and named in a closing NOTE, so the PASS line's claim
# ("reached their documented prompt") stays true and an unrun option never looks verified.
#
# THREE OF THE FIVE NEED A PTY, NOT A PIPE, which is not a preference -- a pipe hands the guest
# keystrokes it never asked for and, for the Sol-20, the output never reaches stdout at all
# (it paints the VDM-1's video RAM). Those three reuse the existing acceptance `.exp` scripts
# UNCHANGED, pointed at the extracted package's own files: tests/acceptance/{basic1,diskbasic,
# trek80}.exp already take <binary> and a dir/toml, so proving the SHIPPED file boots is a
# matter of handing them the shipped file.
#
# `expect` IS OPTIONAL, exactly as it is for the acceptance suite. CMakeLists gates every `.exp`
# test behind find_program(expect) and SKIPS them where it is absent -- which is Windows, whose
# Git Bash ships no expect. So this does the same: without expect the two PIPED commands (CP/M,
# 4K BASIC) still run everywhere, and the three pty commands are SKIPPED WITH A LOUD NOTICE
# rather than failing the leg. A skip is reported, never silent -- an unverified command must
# look unverified.
#
# NOT `set -e`. This harness RUNS commands that are expected to fail when the package is wrong
# -- a failed boot is a finding, not a script error -- so failures are handled explicitly and
# tallied, and the script's own exit status is the count of findings.
#
#   usage: tools/verify-package.sh [--keep] [--require-notarized] <archive>
#
#     --keep     Leave the scratch extraction directory instead of deleting it, to debug a
#                failure by hand (the message names the directory).
#     --require-notarized
#                macOS: the program must be signed with a Developer ID, Apple must have
#                notarized it, and it must start with the quarantine mark a browser adds.
#                tools/release-worker.sh passes it; the CI leg, which signs ad hoc, does not.
#                Without it, a macOS package still gets `codesign --verify --strict`.
#     <archive>  dist/altairsim-X.Y.Z-<target>.tar.gz or .zip -- what build-package.sh wrote.
